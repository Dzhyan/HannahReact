After seeing some of the children at Kyle Primary making a stop motion animation earlier in the year, I decided that it would be a great thing to try with all the schools! So, I began by ordering 20kg of different coloured plasticine bars and I put a few pieces of each colour in an assortment of egg boxes. I went into the schools, egg boxes piled high, and said to the children: “We’re going to make stop motion animations! But first, we need to make some characters to animate with!” I invited them to take inspiration for the natural world, they could make plants or animals or anything from nature. They had so much fun and their creations were beautiful!
