As the school summer holidays set in, I decided to create an activity that adults could get involved in. I’ve always wanted to have a freestyle dance club in my area but I’ve never known of one to exist, so I decided to start my own. I had recently joined the local Skye Circus Skills club and, when talking to some of the people there, a few of them said they would be interested in a freestyle dance club. I gathered more people I knew who were interested and booked Kyle Hall. I decided to call the club Free Flow Dance. The first session was great! After some warm up stretches, I invited everyone to take a piece of floaty fabric and use it as a partner to dance with. I find it can make it easier to dance freestyle if I have something to focus on and it seemed to work really well for them. We then explored animal movement... More detail to come soon…
