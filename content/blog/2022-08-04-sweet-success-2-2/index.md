I've spent quite some time trying to summarise the whole background of how this project came about and now I've gone crosseyed and my brain has turned into tangled spaghetti! So, if you feel confused after reading it, feel free to get in touch! 

It all started with [Creative Scotland](https://www.creativescotland.com/) which is a funding body for the arts.

[Culture Collective](https://culturecollective.scot/about/) is a Scotland-wide project, funded by the Government emergency COVID-19 funds through Creative Scotland, intending to revive communities who have suffered the isolating effects of the pandemic.

26 Scottish organisations successfully applied for this funding, one of which was [SEALL](https://www.seall.co.uk/): the performing arts promoters based in Portree on the Isle of Skye. [ATLAS Arts](https://atlasarts.org.uk/) and [Fèisean nan Gàidheal](https://www.feisean.org/en/) are two organisations who are SEALL’s collaborators for the project. 

SEALL hired six artists to creatively enliven the communities across Lochalsh, Skye and Raasay. Each of the artists are interacting with the communities using their own unique creative skills.

[Aiseirigh](https://culturecollective.scot/projects/aiseirigh/) is the Gaelic word we chose for our group’s title as it translates to revival; it seemed appropriate.

'We are Nature' is the name that I chose for my individual project.

I am absolutely delighted to be one of SEALL's six artists and I am so incredibly grateful that the amazing artist [Greg Dobson](https://gregdobsonmetalworks.co.uk/) told the lovely people at SEALL about me through a serendipitous conversation when they were looking for artists!

Here is an oversimplified visual of the above, inspired by / stolen from Daniel Cullen, my fellow artist:
