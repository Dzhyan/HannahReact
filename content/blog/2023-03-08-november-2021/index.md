I got on a roll with exploring the possibilities of the fabric scraps; making anything I could think of with the children. I taught them plaits and knots which many kids didn’t know; gone are the days of shoe laces. The common use of velcro shoe straps has meant that many children have a lack of opportunity for the motor skills development of tying knots. 

As well as this, I started doing nature connection activities with the kids out in their playgrounds.

We did sensory searches including: What smells can you find? Can you taste the air? How many different colours can you find? How many shapes can you see? What different textures can you feel in the nature around you? 

It was amazing how many smooth textures we found! When I think of nature I think of things like bumpy bark, nobbly rocks and curly lichen. But we also found soft grass, smooth stones, velvet moss and glossy leaves. It was a beautiful surprise to find so much inspiration in the playground! 

We also made leaf pictures, adding twigs and berries and other bits and pieces for detail.

As the weather was getting colder by the day I tried to find more active creative activities for the playground so I looked into animal movement. I wrote a list of animals and brought the children outside so we could imitate them as if in their “wild” habitat. They had so much fun! And of course they were very good at making animal sounds too. :)

Trying so many varied activities allowed me to see what interested the children. With this knowledge I could lead towards focusing more intently on one creative activity without worrying that they were missing out on all the other skills and fun aspects of art I could show them.

It was so much fun to do these creative activities in all three primary schools and I wanted to go into more schools each week but it just wasn’t energetically possible for me. Whilst on a walk in my village I got chatting with a neighbour who homeschools one of her children and she gave me the contact of another mum who home schools her children. So I soon went to their houses and started with some fun drawing activities! We then did some textile work with the scraps.
