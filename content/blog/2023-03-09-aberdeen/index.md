In December, Ruari Gordon (our Project Leader at the time) took our Aiseirigh group (the 5 of us who could make it) to visit two other Culture Collective groups so we could share our projects with each other.

On our way to visit a group in Aberdeen we visited a Transition Town in Forres which had a beautiful allotment and a small building where we gathered for lunch to discuss our projects with the Combine2Create team (another group who are part of the Culture Collective). During our discussion with the Combine2Create team, they talked about the concept of revisiting our roots and exploring our sense of belonging within our community which is a theme that is running through some of our own projects as well. Rachel, one of the artists, said that she intended to work with marginalised groups in her community to do creative activities with them. She spoke about how using and developing our creative skills can be so empowering and it’s a great way to socialise in a non-pressured way. It was great to meet the Combine2Create team and see what similarities our projects have. It was also great to discuss the unusual nature of the project with them; working without a fixed outcome and how we’ve navigated that challenge but also felt the liberation of it.

When we arrived in Aberdeen we had a great discussions within our group over dinner and drinks about many ideas and concepts. Daniel raised the question: “Can we be content and ambitious at the same time?” It provoked a really interesting discussion and we shared our thoughts about what it’s like to live as creative people; with a continual desire to create and improve which can often leave us in discontentment. It made me think about the creative process of nothing ever feeling totally finished; there’s always more we can do and add to our creations… the universe it forever expanding…

The next day, we visited the Culture Collective group called Safe Harbour Open Seas in their shared studio space. It was great to see that they had a space to work alongside each other as this is one thing that we don’t really have in my group and it’s something we might have benefitted from. But, as our group is so spread out across Skye and Lochalsh and beyond, over many miles, it’s just not practical to have a shared studio. The whole trip made me really appreciate being in the same room as my team; it was so great to spend a couple of days getting to know each other better and to share our ideas.

It was really valuable to have the opportunity to connect with the other Culture Collective groups. Overall, it was a worthwhile trip to make connections and see how the other groups are working together with their communities.
