The brief for this project is very open to allow time for us artists to connect with our community and \[amazingly!\] there is no expectation for a finished outcome which takes the pressure off and allows us to explore and let the people we’re working with influence what becomes of this project.

Obviously there will inevitably be some kind of showing/exhibition of what we’ve all done but also one outcome of the project is that we have enriched people’s lives and nurtured their self expression which, for me, is the most important part of all.

On one hand the open brief gave me a wonderful sense of freedom, but it also gave me a frightening feeling of “oh no, where do I start? What am I going to do?” 

Having trained as a costume designer/maker, I started with the idea to engage the primary school children in making simple textiles inspired by lichen, moss and seaweed, with the aim to sew them all together into a patchwork cloak that would look almost like a warped map of the areas surrounding the schools. 

I started the project around the end of June 2021 and, as it was the school summer holiday time, it gave me a chance to plan ahead and wrap my head around how I was going to do things. Then, in mid July I started going into Auchtertyre Primary and Corry Capers forest school in Broadford. To begin bringing my initial idea to life, I spent a lot of time cutting strips of fabric and making little holes in fabric patches, so that the children could easily tie the strips onto them to make fluffy organic textiles to be pieced together into a cloak. The kids loved it and did an amazing job! …but I quickly realised that I had spent hours preparing fabric for a predetermined idea that they chomped their way through in minutes. I had to turn the process on its head to allow more time and freedom for the children to express their own creativity and much less time for me to spend preparing materials.
