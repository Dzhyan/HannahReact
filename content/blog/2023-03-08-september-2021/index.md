After realising that my patchwork cloak idea was a bit impractical and rigid, I really struggled to find a new steppingstone for the project that would allow for more freedom of expression, but one that would’t be so freeing that the children felt lost about what they were meant to do.

I spoke with Marie Lewis from SEALL (our project leader at the time) and she inspired me to find a creature that we could learn about and draw inspiration from. I pondered the idea and eventually came across a zine I bought a few years ago by Emily Lowes called Siphonophores. 

Siphonophores are underwater organisms made up of many different creatures that play different roles such as: swimming, catching prey, eating and sharing nutrients between each creature to make sure they all prosper as one unified organism. They’re basically creatures that have a community within themselves. I was thrilled to explore this as a theme as it made me focus on the concept of community; the heart of my project. 

We can also imagine our own bodies as a community of organs all serving a unique purpose to keep us alive. Food for thought…

So, I started off by bringing siphonophore images into Auchtertyre Primary for the children to draw. I showed them a blind drawing a technique that I have renamed ‘seeing drawing’ because it means that you have to look at what you’re drawing and don’t look at the page. Sometimes you look down after a few minutes of drawing and there’s a bizarre squiggle staring back at you, or sometimes you look down and see a quirky masterpiece that you never imagined you could produce! It’s a fun way to loosen up and it can actually make us more skilful drawers overtime when we incorporate the balance of observation and briefly looking at the paper to check where we are. It’s also great for people who say “I can’t draw” to which I reply “yes you can, try this!”

I also brought in some pieces of floaty fabric so that the children could throw the fabric in the air and watch it float around; much like how siphonophores move in the water.

As well as this, I took the children outside and we did some splashy ink drawings inspired by what nature they could see around them. It’s a great way to get expressing without thinking too much about making a neat, accurate piece of art.
