In a serendipitous interaction, I was given a massive basket of fabric scraps from local textile artist, Erica MacDonald who wanted to get rid of them.

In the depths of winter, I felt like I was scrambling around for inspiration in the dark. I decided to continue the siphonophore theme with the fabric so I went into Kyle Primary School and we made little creatures out of the scraps, they loved it! We stuck googly eyes on and some children made their creature into a puppet by tying a length of thread to its head so that they could bob it up and down and make it walk and talk! Once we had all finished making a creature (or two, or three) we put them all together on the floor and the it looked bit like a fun fabric siphonophore!

I went into Kyle Primary again and, in small groups, we brought our puppets to life by making them talk to each other and interact though movement; the children had lots of fun exploring their performing side!

I also went into Loch Duich Primary and we went outside and made leaf pictures!
