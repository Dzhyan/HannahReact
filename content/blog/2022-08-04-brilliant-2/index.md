Welcome to my blog : )

I hope you’ve been out in nature today… filled your lungs with fresh air and felt the earth beneath your feet.

Thank you for coming to have a gander at what I've been up to. It’s taken a lot of courage to start posting things here as I’m often a bit shy about sharing my artistic process on the internet and I’m writing this blog retrospectively so I didn’t know quite where to start… but now here we are, a blank page no more. \[phew!\]

So, a bit of context: I’m doing a project called We Are Nature in which I go into my local schools and visit some homeschooled children each week and we do all sorts of creative activities and, if it’s not to stormy outside, we do these activities out in the playground and beyond …where we’re meant to be : )

Over the next wee while I’ll be posting what we’ve done to show you the journey of the project.
