Before I was even welcomed aboard this project, the head teachers of some of the local primary schools approached SEALL, asking if they had any way of getting more creative input for the children. The primary schools in Lochalsh used to have a weekly peripatetic art teacher who would travel to each school and deliver curriculum-based art lessons. They don’t have an art teacher anymore, which is especially worrying as all these children have experienced the anxiety-inducing effects of the pandemic with very little nurtured creative expression. 

So back in May 2021, while the lovely people at SEALL were looking for artists for the Culture Collective project, they went to have a chat with the incredible local artist known as Greg Dobson. They said that they were looking for an emerging artist who does performance and environmental art, so Greg told them about me and soon after I met with them and they apparently liked what I had to say as I got the job!! I was absolutely gobsmacked to have been gifted with a paid creative opportunity in my local area! At the time, I was working as a Pupil Support Assistant alongside Greg in Plockton High School so it was a neat transition that I would then be working with the local primary schools through SEALL. I’m so glad to be able to live and work in Lochalsh and give back to the primary schools that I’ve known since I was a wee one. If I hadn’t been taken onboard for this project I might have ended up moving to the central belt to find a creative job down there.

So, why did I choose the title We are Nature?

I chose it because we seem to have forgotten the fact that we _are_ Nature. We are animals wearing clothes. 

Every day, many of us wake up on a synthetic mattress, step onto a manmade floor and, before leaving the house, we put on shoes to avoid stepping on the actual earth (even though a lot of where we walk is on paving slabs and tarmac). Many of us spend our days working in little boxes that we call buildings and, although life is now very convenient, it has lead us to become detached from Nature; where we came from and where we belong.

One aim of my project is to reconnect people with Nature. The current global environmental crisis seems to be a result of humans believing that they are separate from nature which allows them to blindly abuse the natural world. I hope that we can return to living more harmoniously with nature and give our children a prosperous future on this beautiful planet.

Having said all of this, I drive my fuel-burning car to work and sometimes don’t make time to be out in nature because I’m too busy working inside. I feel there is a lot of negativity and guilt surrounding the topic of humankind’s not so kind relationship with nature, but I aim to take a positive path during this project to inspire more empathy for the natural world and plant seeds of hope in people’s minds.
