Roadmap: Migrating Blog to React Site with Netlify CMS
1. Preparation & Planning

    Review the current site structure and where you want the blog to appear (e.g., /blog).
    Decide on the URL structure for blog posts (e.g., /blog/my-first-post).
    Confirm you have access to the site’s GitHub repository and Netlify account.

2. Set Up Blog Structure in React

    Create a /blog page or directory in your React project.
    Decide on a format for blog posts (Markdown files in a /content/blog or /posts folder is common).
    Build a component/page to list all blog posts.
    Build a component/page to display individual blog posts.

3. Migrate Content from WordPress

    Export blog posts from WordPress (typically via Tools > Export, outputting XML).
    Convert exported posts to Markdown format (tools like wordpress-to-markdown or manual conversion).
    Add frontmatter to each Markdown file (YAML at the top with title, date, author, etc.).
    Place Markdown files in the designated /posts or /content/blog folder.

4. Integrate Netlify CMS

    Install Netlify CMS as a dependency (npm install netlify-cms-app or use a CDN).
    Add an /admin route to your site and create an admin folder with an index.html for the CMS.
    Create a config.yml file for Netlify CMS, defining collections (e.g., blog posts) and fields (e.g., title, body, image).
    Configure the CMS to work with your GitHub repo (using Git Gateway or GitHub authentication).
    Deploy your site to Netlify and enable Identity/Git Gateway in your Netlify dashboard.

5. Style and Test

    Style the blog list and post pages to match your site’s branding.
    Test creating, editing, and deleting posts via Netlify CMS.
    Make sure published/edited posts update the live site after each commit/deploy.
    Optionally, set up previews for posts in the CMS.

6. Add Comments (Optional)

    Integrate a third-party service like Disqus or Giscus for comments.
    Add the comment component to your blog post template.

7. Train the Site Owner

    Provide simple documentation or a walkthrough for logging in to /admin, creating/editing posts, and uploading images.
    Ensure the site owner can perform all basic tasks without technical help.

8. Launch & Maintenance

    Do a final review and QA.
    Announce the migration to users/readers if relevant.
    Periodically update dependencies and check that Netlify CMS and the site’s build are working smoothly.

Let me know if you’d like a sample config.yml for Netlify CMS, or a starter implementation of any part of this!










Set up Netlify Identity

    In your Netlify dashboard, go to your site → Identity → Enable Identity.
    Set registration to “Invite only” so only you can add users.

Enable Git Gateway

    In Identity → Services, enable Git Gateway.
    Connect it to your GitHub repo.

Configure Netlify CMS

    In your repo, add the admin/config.yml file for Netlify CMS.
    Set backend: to use git-gateway.
    Limit the CMS “collections” to only the blog posts or content folders (not /src, /components, etc.).

Example:
YAML

backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main # or your deploy branch
media_folder: "static/images/uploads"
public_folder: "/images/uploads"
collections:
  - name: "blog"
    label: "Blog"
    folder: "content/blog"
    create: true
    fields:
      - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
      - { label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown" }

Invite Your Client

    In Netlify Identity, invite your client by email.
    They’ll receive a secure invite to set their password and can log in at /admin.

Test Permissions

    Log in as your client and confirm that:
        They can add/edit blog posts.
        They cannot see or edit code, settings, or other sensitive files.

Deploy and Document

    Make sure the CMS works in production.
    Give your client a simple doc or screencast for logging in and editing posts.
